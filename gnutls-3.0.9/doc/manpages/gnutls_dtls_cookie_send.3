.sp
.BI "int gnutls_dtls_cookie_send(gnutls_datum_t* " key ", void* " client_data ", size_t " client_data_size ", gnutls_dtls_prestate_st* " prestate ", gnutls_transport_ptr_t " ptr ", gnutls_push_func " push_func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_datum_t* key" 12
is a random key to be used at cookie generation
.IP "void* client_data" 12
contains data identifying the client (i.e. address)
.IP "size_t client_data_size" 12
The size of client's data
.IP "gnutls_dtls_prestate_st* prestate" 12

.IP "gnutls_transport_ptr_t ptr" 12
A transport pointer to be used by  \fIpush_func\fP
.IP "gnutls_push_func push_func" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to prevent denial of service
attacks to a DTLS server by requiring the client to
reply using a cookie sent by this function. That way
it can be ensured that a client we allocated resources
for (i.e. \fBgnutls_session_t\fP) is the one that the 
original incoming packet was originated from.
.SH "RETURNS"
the number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  
.SH "SINCE"
