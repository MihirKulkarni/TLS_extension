.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", unsigned int " seq ", int " what ", gnutls_datum_t * " data ", int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
Holds the certificate
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the access descriptor (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "int what" 12
what data to get, a \fBgnutls_info_access_what_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
output data to be freed with \fBgnutls_free()\fP.
.IP "int * critical" 12
pointer to output integer that is set to non\-0 if the extension is marked as critical (may be \fBNULL\fP)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function extracts the Authority Information Access (AIA)
extension, see RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1 for more information.  The
AIA extension holds a sequence of AccessDescription (AD) data:

<informalexample><programlisting>
.SH "AUTHORITYINFOACCESSSYNTAX"
:=
SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF AccessDescription
.SH "ACCESSDESCRIPTION"
:=  SEQUENCE {
accessMethod          OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
accessLocation        GeneralName  }
</programlisting></informalexample>

The  \fIseq\fPinput parameter is used to indicate which member of the
sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the
second member 1 and so on.  When the  \fIseq\fPvalue is out of bounds,
\fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is returned.

The type of data returned in  \fIdata\fPis specified via  \fIwhat\fPwhich
should be \fBgnutls_info_access_what_t\fP values.

If  \fIwhat\fPis \fBGNUTLS_IA_ACCESSMETHOD_OID\fP then  \fIdata\fPwill hold the
accessMethod OID (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1").

If  \fIwhat\fPis \fBGNUTLS_IA_ACCESSLOCATION_GENERALNAME_TYPE\fP,  \fIdata\fPwill
hold the accessLocation GeneralName type (e.g.,
"uniformResourceIdentifier").

If  \fIwhat\fPis \fBGNUTLS_IA_URI\fP,  \fIdata\fPwill hold the accessLocation URI
data.  Requesting this  \fIwhat\fPvalue leads to an error if the
accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

If  \fIwhat\fPis \fBGNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI\fP,  \fIdata\fPwill hold the OCSP URI.
Requesting this  \fIwhat\fPvalue leads to an error if the accessMethod
is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 aka OSCP, or if accessLocation is not of
the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

If  \fIwhat\fPis \fBGNUTLS_IA_CAISSUERS_URI\fP,  \fIdata\fPwill hold the caIssuers
URI.  Requesting this  \fIwhat\fPvalue leads to an error if the
accessMethod is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2 aka caIssuers, or if
accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

More  \fIwhat\fPvalues may be allocated in the future as needed.

If  \fIdata\fPis NULL, the function does the same without storing the
output data, that is, it will set  \fIcritical\fPand do error checking
as usual.

The value of the critical flag is returned in * \fIcritical\fP.  Supply a
NULL  \fIcritical\fPif you want the function to make sure the extension
is non\-critical, as required by RFC 5280.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP on
invalid  \fIcrt\fP, \fBGNUTLS_E_CONSTRAINT_ERROR\fP if the extension is
incorrectly marked as critical (use a non\-NULL  \fIcritical\fPto
override), \fBGNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM\fP if the requested OID does
not match (e.g., when using \fBGNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI\fP), otherwise a
negative error code.
