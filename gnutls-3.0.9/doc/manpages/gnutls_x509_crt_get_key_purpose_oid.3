.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_purpose_oid \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_purpose_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", int " indx ", void * " oid ", size_t * " oid_size ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "int indx" 12
This specifies which OID to return. Use (0) to get the first one.
.IP "void * oid" 12
a pointer to a buffer to hold the OID (may be null)
.IP "size_t * oid_size" 12
initially holds the size of  \fIoid\fP
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
output flag to indicate criticality of extension
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the key purpose OIDs of the Certificate
specified by the given index.  These are stored in the Extended Key
Usage extension (2.5.29.37) See the GNUTLS_KP_* definitions for
human readable names.

If  \fIoid\fPis null then only the size will be filled. If the  \fIraw_flag\fPis not specified the output is always null terminated, although the
 \fIoid_size\fPwill not include the null character.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the *oid_size will be updated
with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
