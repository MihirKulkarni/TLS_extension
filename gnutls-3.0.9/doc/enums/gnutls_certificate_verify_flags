@itemize
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-CA_@-SIGN
If set a signer does not have to be
a certificate authority. This flag should normaly be disabled,
unless you know what this means.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-X509_@-V1_@-CA_@-CRT
Allow trusted CA certiﬁcates
with version 1. This is safer than @code{GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT},
and should be used instead. That way only signers in your trusted list
will be allowed to have certiﬁcates of version 1. This is the default.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-SAME
If a certificate is not signed by
anyone trusted but exists in the trusted CA list do not treat it
as trusted.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-ANY_@-X509_@-V1_@-CA_@-CRT
Allow CA certificates that
have version 1 (both root and intermediate). This might be
dangerous since those haven't the basicConstraints
extension. Must be used in combination with
@code{GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT}.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-SIGN_@-RSA_@-MD2
Allow certificates to be signed
using the broken MD2 algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-SIGN_@-RSA_@-MD5
Allow certificates to be signed
using the broken MD5 algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-TIME_@-CHECKS
Disable checking of activation
and expiration validity periods of certificate chains. Don't set
this unless you understand the security implications.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-TRUSTED_@-TIME_@-CHECKS
If set a signer in the trusted
list is never checked for expiration or activation.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-X509_@-V1_@-CA_@-CRT
Do not allow trusted CA
certificates that have version 1.  This option is to be used
to deprecate all certificates of version 1.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-CRL_@-CHECKS
Disable checking for validity
using certificate revocation lists.
